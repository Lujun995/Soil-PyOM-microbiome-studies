Source code from the manuscript: Habitat heterogeneity induced by pyrogenic organic matter in wildfire-perturbed soils mediates bacterial community assembly processes.

This study collected samples from two independent sites (the Zhejiang site and the Jiangxi site) and their data were deposit in the two folders Zhejiang and Jiangxi, respectively. The Zhejiang folder comprises source code to prepare OTU and taxonomy tables and 5 child folders. These 5 child folders are "1 Description and Ordinations", "2 Specialists Selection and Sensitivity Analysis", "3 Phylogenetic coherence", "4 Co-ocurrence Network" and "5 Simulated Community". These folders link to the corresponding parts in our manuscript with 1 -> Bacterial community analysis, 2, 3 and 4 -> Phylogenetic coherence of habitat specialists and 5 -> Reconstructing the bacterial community of burnt soils.

The Jiangxi folder comprises all the analyses with each analysis are seperated using comment marks.
