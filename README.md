# Habitat heterogeneity induced by pyrogenic organic matter in wildfire-perturbed soils mediates bacterial community assembly processes.

- This project contains the source code from the manuscript *Habitat heterogeneity induced by pyrogenic organic matter in wildfire-perturbed soils mediates bacterial community assembly processes.*
- This study investigated microbiomes in soil and PyOM samples collected from two independent sites (the **Zhejiang** site and the **Jiangxi** site). Data and source code of these two sites were deposited into two folders **Zhejiang** and **Jiangxi**, respectively. 
- Documents ended with **\_main.R** are the main R script for the corresponding analyses. Those ended simply with **.R** are required functions. Those ended with **.csv**, **.tre**, **.d**, **.RData** etc. are required datasets.

### The Zhejiang folder

- The Zhejiang folder comprises source code to prepare OTU and taxonomy tables and 5 child folders. 
- These 5 child folders are 
    1. Description and Ordinations
    2. Specialists Selection and Sensitivity Analysis
    3. Phylogenetic coherence
    4. Co-occurrence Network
    5. Simulated Community
- These five folders link to one corresponding part in our manuscript.
 - Bacterial community analysis <- 1
 - Phylogenetic coherence of habitat specialists <- 2, 3 and 4 
 - Reconstructing the bacterial community of burnt soils <- 5

### The Jiangxi folder
- The **Jiangxi_main.r** comprises all the analyses
- Each analysis is separated using comments.
