# Source code from the manuscript: Habitat heterogeneity induced by pyrogenic organic matter in wildfire-perturbed soils mediates bacterial community assembly processes.

- This study collected samples from two independent sites (the 'Zhejiang' site and the 'Jiangxi' site) and their data were deposit in the two folders 'Zhejiang' and 'Jiangxi', respectively. 
- The documents ended with **\_main.R** are the main R script for the corresponding analyses. those ended simply with **.R** are required functions. Those ended with **.csv**, **.tre**, **.d**, **.RData** etc. are required datasets.

### The Zhejiang foldfer

- The Zhejiang folder comprises source code to prepare OTU and taxonomy tables and 5 child folders. 
- These 5 child folders are "1 Description and Ordinations", "2 Specialists Selection and Sensitivity Analysis", "3 Phylogenetic coherence", "4 Co-ocurrence Network" and "5 Simulated Community". 
- These five folders link to one corresponding part in our manuscript. 1 -> Bacterial community analysis, 2, 3 and 4 -> Phylogenetic coherence of habitat specialists and 5 -> Reconstructing the bacterial community of burnt soils.

### The Jiangxi folder
- The Jiangxi folder comprises all the analyses
- Each analysis are seperated using comments.
